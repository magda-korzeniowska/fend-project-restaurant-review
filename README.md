## Project Description

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, students were given [a starter code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) - to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Students had to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Students also had to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for their users.

## Specification

The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn't include any standard accessibility features, and it didn't work offline at all. Student's job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

## Installation
1. Clone repository using:

    `$ git clone https://github.com/magda-korzeniowska/fend-project-restaurant-review`

2.  In terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -v`

    If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

     If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
     For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`

4. This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
